# Cleaning with Python

## Overview

This project provides a Python-based solution for data cleaning and preprocessing. The notebook, `Cleaning_with_Python.ipynb`, contains various techniques and methods to handle common data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, data type conversions, outlier detection, and more.

## Features

- **Missing Data Handling**: Techniques to handle missing values through imputation, removal, or interpolation.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Methods to ensure that all data is in the correct format for further analysis.
- **Outlier Detection**: Tools to detect and handle outliers in the dataset.
- **Data Normalization**: Processes to normalize or standardize data to improve model performance.
- **Custom Functions**: Includes reusable functions for common cleaning tasks, allowing easy adaptation to different datasets.
